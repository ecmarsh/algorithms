 * [309] Best Time to Buy/Sell Stocks with Cooldown
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price
 * of a given stock on day i.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete
 * as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one
 * share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 *   - You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time
 *    (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *   - After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day.
 *     (ie, cooldown 1 day)
 *
 * @example
 * Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
 *
 * @complexity
 * Time: O()
 * Space: O()
