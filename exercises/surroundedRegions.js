 *
 * [130] Surrounded Regions
 *
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O),
 * capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 *
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's
 * in that surrounded region.
 *
 * @example
 * Board:
 *  X X X X
 *  X O O X
 *  X X O X
 *  X O X X
 * After running function, board should be:
 *  X X X X
 *  X X X X
 *  X X X X
 *  X O X X
 * Explanation:
 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any
 * 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O'
 * that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O'
 * on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they
 * are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
 *
 * @complexity
 * Time: O(M x N) -> limited by last loop through on board
 * Space: O(M x N) worst case recursive space if one O on border and everything
 * inside of the board is O, has to DFS through entire board.
